## Open source issue tracking systems
I started using open source issue tracking system to manage my own work.

1. [Reference](https://opensource.com/business/16/2/top-issue-support-and-bug-tracking-tools)
This page recommends four different open source issue tracker: redmine, bugzilla, trac and mantis.
2. I tried installing trac on windows with Anaconda 2.7. It was successful, but I need to work on Authentication in order to create a user.
3. I ended up using Redmine which is written in Ruby on Rails. It follows the conventions of rails apps. What is really helpful is [bitnami](bitnami.md).
This company provides self-contained packages for a bunch of web apps for different OS. For example, bugzilla and mantis can also be installed
using bitnami's standalone packages.
