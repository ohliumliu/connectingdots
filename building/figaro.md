* Souce: https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro

* Idea: There is a config/application.yml file to set up environment variables. 
Each contributor of the project set it up according their own requirement. 
Other configruation files use the environmental variables, rather than hard coding. This file is ignored in git.

* Advantage:
  ** Flexible.
  ** Secure.
