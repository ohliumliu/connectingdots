## REACT

* Mostly for View

* HTML in JS (in contrast to Angular)

* Very fast. Virtual DOM tree faster than actual DOM tree. Use ref attribute to find element.

* Server indepenent

* Modular. Everything including html is in js.

* Data flow direction is top-down or down-top.

* Rendering is on server. Good for SEO.

* <script type="text/babel"></script> Need to use babel to convert js to a compatible one. 
REACT uses JSX language which is a combination of js and html. (similar to erb)

* How to define module: React.createClass
