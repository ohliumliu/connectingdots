#Plan
1. Use session to store user params. Clear session upon logging out.
2. Render alerts with json in controller, render jason: @alerts. In js, use jquery to parse jason and then update view 
 by looping through
3. Use Live Http headers to check cache and cookie
4. Index in db
5. action mailer
5. Display request and play with response (set a header) in controller 

#Progress

##Add signin() in front.js. 

  * Automatically goes to / with params after js execution (fixed, see [[Form action and onsubmit]])
  * test ajax call in browser: return json data is ok.
  * parse json: `var obj = jQuery.parseJSON(data)` But data from rails server is already parsed!! No need to parse it again.
  * update html with ajax return value works
  
## Use firefox debugger:
  * to step through js. make sure it works.
  * generate unique selector for jQuery. This is not the best way. Not compatible with later layout adjustment.

## Update user profile portion using jQuery
  *Generate deleteButton and alert spans dynamically using jQuery. See [[jQuery dynamic construction]] 
  *Generate deletebutton onclick callback dynamically. Avoid [closure](closure.md).
  *Implement delete function. Update alert list after deletion.
