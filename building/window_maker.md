## Window Maker as a low resource window manager
My laptop is too old to run Unity and I decided to switch to Window Maker.

## Configuration
* Useful [resource](https://administratosphere.wordpress.com/2011/07/16/configuring-a-windowmaker-desktop-in-ubuntu/)
* Remember to configure autostart and set it to be executable.

## Tip
* If window title bar is outside the screen. Do the following
  - Click middle button (or left + right button) to bring up window list.
  - Select the one that is outside the screen.
  - Ctrl+Esc to bring up a menu which could be outside the screen as well. Use down arrow until the menu shows up.
  - Choose Resize/Move. Use arrow key to move and ctrl + arrow to resize.
