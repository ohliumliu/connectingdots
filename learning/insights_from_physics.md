* Feature scaling: Nondimensionalization in fluid mechanics or quantum physics.
* Principle component analysis: Rigid body movement, moment of inertia, prolate/oblate in rotational spectroscopy
* Regularization: addition of pseudo data points
* Entropy cost in decision tree: what is entropy? The equivalent ways to arrange an ensemble.
