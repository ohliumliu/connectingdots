* Choose an architecture
  * Start from 1 hidden layer.
  * Keep hidden layers having the same number of hidden units.
  * Hidden layers should have more units than input/output layers.
* Initialize parameters (weights) at random
* Implement forward propagation calculation of hypothesis function and the calculation of cost function. 
Training set data is used to do the calculation.
* Implement backward propagation calculation of derivative of cost function. Training set data is used to do the calculation.
* Check the calculation of derivative by numerical method. Turn if off afterwards.
* Use gradient descent or other methods to minimize cost function.
