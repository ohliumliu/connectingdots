The Machine Learning class on Coursera by Andrew Ng was the first class I took to get myself into the exciting area of 
machine learning. In fact, this very github repo was started as a collection of thoughts I gathered while watching the class videos.
This class also prompts me to dig deeper in order to understand the mathematical basis of machine learning algorithms. I am 
working on some [notes](https://github.com/ohliumliu/thoughts_learning) for my future reference, although it is from a beginner's 
perspective and far from finished.
